<p class="paragraph">According to <a href="http://www.16personalities.com/">16personalities </a>I have the Virtuoso (ISTP-T) personality type.
I think its quite accurate, atleast for me. I am definitely introverted and i do learn better when i get to fiddle with what im learning, like programming for example.
and i rarely get stressed just kinda go with it, i'd say its pretty much bang on.   </p>
<p class="paragraph"> The results show that ill follow the leader, do what they want but also chip in if i think that something can or should be done in a slightly different way.
  I think ill fit into most groups, but if in a group with multiple quiet people it might be a bit harder to get ideas flowing.
<h2 class="class1"> Learning Type </h2>
<center><img src="images/learningtype.png" width="400"height="150"></center>
<p class="paragraph">I took a <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml">Learning Style Test </a> from education planner
and again its quite accurate, i do enjoy doing to learn. Online has kinda shown how much i prefer doing tasks over listening, as i can do it at my pace and can fidget with it until i feel its right
i think ill fit i most groups again, i can focus on what i need to do and working out solutions if none of us are able to. </p>
<h2 class="class1">Creativity Test </h2>
<center><img src="images/creativitytest.png" width="900"height="150"></center>
<p class="paragraph">I got my creativity test from <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creativity-quiz.htm">mindtools.com</a> I definitely feel im not a very
creative person but im quite good at problem solving, if something doesnt work ill take a look at how someone else has done something or ill brute force it
and just keep trying different things until something sticks. I typically do things the same almost all the time, if it works one way ill continue doing it until im required
to change it to make it work another. Problem solving is much more enjoyable then creating the idea. </p>
