    <p class="paragraph"> Hello, my name is Julian Jai Glover-Bernaldo I'm 25 and Australian born and raised in Melbourne, Victoria. I completed year 12 in 2015/2016
      and have since worked a couple odd jobs but nothing really grabbed my attention. I play competitive CSGO in my freetime, and am very competitive by nature.
      I have very little language knowledge, i've used Unity and Unreal Engine a couple times but didnt take any classes to learn what i was doing just fiddled around.
      which is why I started intro to programming and intro to it to finally give my passion of computers a shot and see if i can get a job doing something i enjoy. </p>
      <h2 class="class1">Interest in IT</h2>
      <p class="paragraph"> I have had an interest in IT for over 20 years, from a really young age my uncle would let me play on his computer and he would show me
        stuff he was able to make and do on his PC. The first memory i have of being blown away by what computers were able to do is my uncle showing me a program he made
        which would put a bullet-hole anywhere you clicked on your screen. It was really quite surreal how he was able to do something like that and since then i've just been
        very interesed in what else is possible. </p>
        <h2 class="class1"> </h2>
        <p class="paragraph"> I am eager to learn some programming and take that knowledge and just keep expanding on it. I did learn a little bit of html in highschool,
          but never thought it would be something i enjoyed to do but learning it correctly i found myself enjoying it quite a bit. </p>
