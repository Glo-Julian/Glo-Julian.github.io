  <h1>My Project Idea</h1>
</header>
<h2 class="class1">Design a video game</h2>
<p class="paragraph">My project is gonna be making a roguelike game. roguelike games are a subgenre of role playing games. You traverse through a procedully generated dungeon in which
everthing you do in that "run" slowly increases your power for the next run. This can be an IOS, android, pc or console game. </p>
<h2 class="class1"> Gametype </h2>
<p class="paragraph">There are quite a few games like this already that i have played - examples are Binding of Isaac where getting further in the game, winning the game and even dying unlocks more items,
  a harder difficulty and new characters. Risk of rain 2, every new run in a complete reset but after doing certain objectives you unlock more items and more characters. It's a pretty niche genre
  but with lots of options and ideas that may not have been done.  </p>
  <h2 class="class1"> Ideas </h2>
<p class="paragraph">Theme would be kinda grim, maybe zombies or aliens have taken over and you are forced to drive them away from different zones.
  Can introduce items and crafting that boost stats. playable on all devices will require some mobile and console programming and licenses. PC will be quite easy
  as we have lots of tools readily available. Art and UI development for menu, maybe cloud networking for cloud saves. Options for multiplayer which hasnt been done too many times.
  The playable character might have different skins/abilities/playstyles aswell as different dialogue - One might love being in this position while another might hate every moment.  </p>
<h2 class="class1">Planning</h2>
<p class="paragraph">I can use Unity, Unreal Engine or other services and build on their engine rather then making my own.
  A decent text and source coding area like ATOM. Art design for characters, mobs(enemies), npcs and items.
Ideas for all the items, stat bonuses, projectile upgrades, damaging debuff and health points  </p>
