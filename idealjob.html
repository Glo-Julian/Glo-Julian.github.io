  <h1>My Ideal Job</h1>
</header>
<p class="paragraph">This question is quite a hard one, as i dont think the answer will be the same in a years time. Even going off of skills I might have in the future.
For example, today im really interested in the technical support side, fixing computers, troubleshooting, helping as much as I can. But i also really enjoy programming so far, making something from scratch
having to think of ways to make it work, the trial and error of it all.   </p>
<h2 class="class1">Technical Support</h2>
<p class="paragraph">I have always been the go-to person in my family and friend group to fix issues that people might have, I find myself able to quickly figure out why something might not be working
as intended. I like Technical Support because its just problem solving, and almost every problem can be solved.  </p>
<h2 class="class1">Game Design</h2>
<p class="paragraph">Game Design is probably the most ideal job. I play games all the time and some games that i play are extremely fun, but lack depth - or riddled with micro transactions
or in the mobile department, riddled with ads. IOS games in particular are just nothing but ads and I think it would be quite cool to have an IOS game that wasnt like that. I watch my neice use her iPad
and every 30 seconds an ad will pop up and its just really disheartening. </p>
<h2 class="class1"> The Choice </h2>
<p class="paragraph"><a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56123237?type=standout#sol=acfb535adb191babf9edb0d8fd4aae3a8d1afc14">Senior Games Programmer</a></p>
<p class="paragraph"> I think Game Design would have to be the choice i make. Gaming has been a huge part in my life, an escape from the real world. I'd need to learn C++
and C# and able to use the Unreal Engine. Currently have very little prorgramming background, taking intro to programming has helped me understand how coding works though and
taking learning html (even if very basic) has been enjoyable and eye opening to how easy you can pick things up aswell as struggle with other parts.  </p>
